            <p>A browser-based game made with react/redux.</p>
            <p>
              This project consists of 2 games both using the same game design
              but slightly different implementations. The game was made
              using the MERN stack. The frontend was made using React
              (hook-based). I used redux for managing the entire application
              state. It also uses XState for game-state management. The styling
              was done using Fluent UI which helps to make pages responsive.
              This project supports multiple languages, implemented using
              localization library i18next. The backend was developed using
              Node/Express and it also contain a PHP Rest API.
            </p>
            <p>
              The objective of this project was to build a complete modular yet scalable
              3-tier client-server architecture project. This project suppors
              multiplayer gameplay as well as chat system. The project was done with accesssibility in mind.

                <h2>Game 1</h2>
                <p>
                  The idea of Game 1 was to create a browser-based multiplayer game where poeple to together solve a crime and accuse a culprit. 
				  One of the main feature of Game 1 was to implement and "Evidence Map", which I implemented using React Flow.	  
                </p>
				<p>
					First I setup a react project with typescript template. I wanted to have different components, each of which did a specific task.
					Inorder to pass data between the components easily I decided to have an application state manager. This is where Redux helped me.
					Setting up Redux takes time, but once it is done it is very useful. For smaller projects Redux might not make much sense. But for 
					a large projects with many components it is definitely a good choice to have Redux.	  
				</p>
				<p>
					The UI was developed using FLuent UI which is Microsofts solution for implementing CSS. Fluent UI does have its limitation
					when trying to customize the UI exactly to you liking but it does help to quick start easily as it has predefined custom elements 
					like buttons, progress bars, nav bars and so on.

                <h2>Game 2</h2>
                <p>
					Game 2 consists of the same design principles and technologies used for Game 1. 
					Contrary to the "Evidence Map" in Game 1, we have "Insight Engine" which also uses React Flow.
					The difference being Insight Engine was a lot more complex to build as each node on the screen
					consists of 5-6 layers of masked svgs which has to be carefully positioned and styled.
                </p>
				<p>
					One other key feature of both the games were the Journal in Game1 and Notebook in Game 2. 
					These features work the almost the same way and is used to help players keep a track of their progress 
					by logging completed activities in the journal/notebook. 
                </p>
				<p>
					Journal/Notebook components are made of 3-4 separate smaller components and this is where Redux was truly helpful. 
					Redux maintains a particular "slice" of different states of game. At any given moment we can fetch these slices to get 
					the data we want. React hooks like useEffect(), useCallback(), useMemo() are used to update the redux.
                </p>

                <h2>Common Features</h2>
                <p>
					One of the most important features of both the games is the XState. XState helps us to manage game state 
					and tranistion from a step to any step based on some conditions. At eaech step we can dispatch any action to update the redux.
					With XState I setup up the entire flow of the games, i.e., players first joins the game -> plays the tutorial -> plays 
					an activity -> get some score -> updates the notebook/journal -> analyze evidence map -> finally accusses the culprit -> summary/end screen. 
					This entire flow was done using XState.
                </p>
				<p>
					The game also contains support for multiple languages. This was acheived using the i18next library, which is a localization library.
					This project was done with accessibility and UX in mind. I wanted players to easily navigate the game thus I made sure the buttons were visible, 
					the color contrast ratio was at least 3:1 ratio, and aria-tags were implemented thorughtout the game.

            <h2>Retrospective</h2>
            <p>
				Ofcourse, this project is not perfect. There are better ways some of the features could have been implemented. 
				Such as components in between Game 1 and 2 should be shared. Although that is not the case. For sake of completion 
				I remade the same component from Game 1 for Game 2 instead of making it resuable. However, this is only true for some of the 
				components, not all. Also I faced some restrictions with Fluent UI. Fluent UI is great for getting a head start with a project 
				however it lacks options to customize you application. Any modifaction to Fluent UI is time taking and would have been better to 
				research a different alternative.
            </p>
            <p>
				The challenging part of this project was to make sure all the different tools and technologies like XState, Redux, i18Next, 
				Fluent UI, the PHP API and the Node Backend all worked in harmony. This project helped me to understand how API works and how to 
				implement multiplayer features to an application. Although it is not perfect, it is a complete solution for a client-server architecture.
